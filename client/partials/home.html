        Grand Canyon National Park spans 277 miles of the Colorado river and adjacent uplands.
        It is located entirely in northern Arizona.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most visitors (90%) choose to see Grand Canyon National
        Park from the overlooks along the South Rim.
        The South Rim, which is the most accessible part of the park,
        includes historic Grand Canyon Village, Hermit Road, and Desert View Drive.
        The South Rim is open all year long, even on holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        A much smaller number of people (10%) see the canyon from the North Rim of the park.
        The North Rim lies just 10 miles across the canyon from the South Rim,
        but it is a 220 mile, or approximately 4.5 hour drive by car, all the way around the canyon.
        It has a shorter season, with lodging and restaurants that are open from May 15 through
        October 15 each year.
      </p>
      <h3>Fees</h3>
      <p>Private Vehicle: $25</p>
